# Youtube-Clone-App
An app where you can search and watch videos. This project was made using the JavaScriptMastery tutorial from YouTube

I added some animations so I can test my skills as a Front-End Developer. This app would work as long as the API works. This app uses RapidAPI with the basic plan(500 limit api requests/month) so the app may not show the videos on the feed or play them in their separate page.
